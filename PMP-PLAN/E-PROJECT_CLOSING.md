**5.0 PROJECT ASSESSMENT**

**5.1 SCOPE**

The project scope was initiated from the beginning of the project. For instance, the system is not able to conduct in fully auto, which need observation from people also by time to time. This system also cannot give the answer out range of the topic since the rules inside the system already train based on the dataset. Besides that, this system only support in Malay and English Language only since we only covered project for Malaysia company.

**5.2 OBJECTIVES**

Our organization, Chatty Co. managed to achieve the objectives by initializing the project based on criteria listed by our sponsor. We have suggested for our company to try new technology, which is Artificial Intelligence (AI), which can handle uncertain situation, like giving the same answer although each customer have different ways to describe the same problem for a question.

**5.3 IMPACTS**

By releasing this project, the workload of customer service workers can be reduced about 30%, which is the simple problem can be solved by using system only. Other than that, this situation can help customer service to focus more on customer that have high priority, such as the suggestion or answers are not fulfil the solution to solve their problems. This system not just focussing on helping customer service workers only, but for customers also. They can get answers quickly without need to wait answers from customer service worker for about 3 to 5 minutes. The time consuming of customers can be reduced and can maintain the level of their patience.
