# Malaysia Car Plate Number Recognition System

This is a project that detect and recognize number plate of car. This project use Artificial Intelligence(AI) technique such as Deep Learning(DL) and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). 

The project is developed by following Project Management Plan(PMP) to better organized the lifecycle of the project. Several charting techniques such as Gantt Chart, Milestone Chart, Work Breakdown Structure(WBS) is used to manage the project.

The PMP-Plan developed is simply a simulation collaboration between third party organization. 

## Project Management Plan
##### Project Summary: [Project Summary](A-PROJECT_SUMMARY.md)
Project Summary give a brief overview of the project objectives and team members details. 

##### Project Planning: [Project Planning](PMP-PLAN/B-PROJECT_PLANNING.md)
Planning processes include devising and maintaining a workable scheme to
ensure that the project addresses the organizationâ€™s needs. Gantt Chart, Work Breakdown Structure(WBS) is documented in this phase.

##### Project Implementation: [Project Implementaion](PMP-PLAN/C-PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
Project Implementation define the project deliverables which included software requirement, Intelligent system architecture and etc.

##### Project Execution: [Project Execution](PMP-PLAN/D-PROJECT_EXECUTION.md)
Project Execution is the execution phase where the result, coding blocks and technical implementation is defined and documented.

##### Project Closing: [Project Closing](PMP-PLAN/E-PROJECT_CLOSING.md)
Project Closing indicate the end of the project lifecycle where the project need to document closing document and lesson learnt report.

##### Project Presentation: [Project Presentation](PMP-PLAN/F-PROJECT_PRESENTATION.md)
Project Presentation shows the demonstration of the car plate recognition system developed by QTMT INC. 
## Sample Result

**Result using Tkinter:**

**Result using Web API:**
The Web API developed with this Interface is for Proof of Concept (POC) and does not mean to be used in the real implementation. The real implementation would be embeded inside Raspberry PI 4 or Nano Jetson.
